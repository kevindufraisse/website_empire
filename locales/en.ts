      question: 'How do I get started?',
      answer: 'Two ways: 1) Join our live Q&A session (Tuesday 1PM or Thursday 1PM CET) to see everything and ask questions, OR 2) Skip the demo and start immediately at join.empire-internet.com/bdc-empire. Either way, your first content is ready in 7 days.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How much time do I need to invest?',
      answer: 'Just 15 minutes per week for the interview call. That\'s it. We handle everything else — content creation, editing, scheduling, and distribution across all platforms.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What if the content doesn\'t sound like me?',
      answer: 'We train custom AI prompts on your unique tone, voice, and style. Plus, a real human reviews and polishes every piece before it goes live. If something feels off, we revise it until it\'s perfect.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How quickly will I see results?',
      answer: 'Your first batch of content is ready within 7 days of your first interview. Most clients see their first engagement spike within 2 weeks, and significant growth by month 2-3.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What makes this different from hiring a content agency?',
      answer: 'Speed, cost, and quality. Agencies cost €5K-15K/month, take weeks to deliver, and often miss your voice. We deliver 30+ pieces in 7 days for €1K/month, with human QA on everything.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I cancel anytime?',
      answer: 'Yes. No long-term contract. You can cancel with 30 days notice. But most clients stay because they see the results and love getting their time back.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Why no free trial or money-back guarantee?',
      answer: 'We have a real team working on your content from day 1 — writers, editors, QA specialists. A free trial would mean they work for free, which isn\'t sustainable. Instead, we offer weekly payment (test for 1 week) and cancel anytime. You see the quality immediately without long-term commitment.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What platforms do you publish to?',
      answer: 'We cover all major platforms: LinkedIn, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter/X, Threads, and email newsletters. You can choose which ones you want to focus on.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Why are there only a few testimonials?',
      answer: 'Empire Internet launched less than 2 months ago. We\'re intentionally keeping it small — maximum 100 clients total — to maintain quality and personal attention. Current clients are already seeing results, and we\'re collecting testimonials as we grow.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Do I need to be on camera or have video equipment?',
      answer: 'No camera needed for the interview. We record the audio and create video content using b-roll, stock footage, and professional editing. You just need to talk.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Do you write in languages other than English?',
      answer: 'Yes! With the API bonus, you get auto-translation to 10+ languages including French, Spanish, German, and more. Perfect for expanding your international reach.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is the AI Setter included or extra?',
